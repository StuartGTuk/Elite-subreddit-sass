# /r/EliteDangerous Sass code
Based on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) we have various modules and partials we use to structure the subreddit stylesheet, including sprites which is Compass' main function.

This is the official stylesheet and will be updated as we make new modules etc. ourselves. Any contributions are welcome, especially regarding effectivity, changing to more modern scripts and so on. You are free to use this to your subreddit, especially so if it is in regards to an Elite Dangerous orientated one. Questions should be made via an issue and we'll answer them as best we can.

Main contributors to the style prior to GitHub integration are Nouv, SpyTec and StuartGT.

The subreddit theme itself is based off of some other reddit theme we have forgotten the name of, anyone who can point us in the right direction and we'll add in their credit.

## Usage

1. Install [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)
1. Compile in root directory with `compass compile` for single-use or `compass watch` for compiling just in time.
1. Profit!
